# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project : Stack Overflow Developer Survey

## Capstone Project Objective

In this work, I gathered data in a variety of formats, such as csv files, excel sheets, and databases, by scraping websites on the internet and gaining access to APIs. Once this was done, I used the data wrangling techniques to prepare the data for analysis. When the data was ready, I used statistical analysis to examine the data. Then, I used IBM Cognos Analytics to build my dashboard and combine all of my data. Finally, I shared my findings in a presentation to showcase my narrative abilities.
