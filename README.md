# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

## Capstone Project Objective

I'll start by gathering data in a variety of formats, such as.csv files, excel sheets, and databases, by scraping websites on the internet and gaining access to APIs.Once this is done, I will use data wrangling techniques to prepare the data for analysis.When the data is ready, I should use statistical analysis to examine the data.Then, use IBM Cognos Analytics to build my dashboard and combine all of my data.Finally, share my findings in a presentation to showcase my narrative abilities. Both the final project presentation and the quizzes in each module will be used to grade me.
